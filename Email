I think there could be something there. Good job thinking of this. 

One thing: why kinect? I don't see the utility of gesture in this app. How about a voice command? Whenever someone says "cheese"?

Might be nice for participants to be able to decide if it's a keeper before it goes online

Maybe always take 3 pics 3 secs apart or something (like a photo booth)

While u intend to use this at weddings, it is more broadly interesting. So in your brainstorming phases try to think of other situations/events as well. Capture all the ideas an then later whittle down to what you want for now (but never toss the brainstorming stuff)

Kind of related(?): say some people couldn't be at the event, if they are known to your system, you could notify them during the event that its photo time, and they could take a pic from wherever they're at to include in all this

What about effects? Instagram/photobooth.app or on some web cams, they come with effects that track heads an pit silly hats on

Or maybe minor/funny editing after or writing messages

Is the background a green screen? Then you could let them pic stuff. 

What props? If some are solid colt with fiducial markers, you could allow them to choose from virtual overlays onto the prop
