MessageBooth
=============

A way to communicate with messages for events for remote and attending participants. 

Events are held often.   They often are inbetween celebratory and informative, rarely on either pole, with many smaller events occuring along this linear connection.   MessageBooth tries to address the particpatory aspects of large events, by providing a centralized collection of individual and group messages (audio, visual, and electronic) by participants of the event, those in atttendance and remotely.  

Other Potential Names
-
MemoRandom - each message would be a memo , normal spelling is memorandum | memorandom.com is newly registered
BulletinBoard - Each meassage would be a bullet, the display is the board

Local Interface
-----
A large screen display to organize and present the messages.   A device to provide locally created messages beyond particpants' personal devices will allow for a primary Message creator.   An HD camera, computer (hopefully thinclient or laptop), internet device or connection, and a large screen HDTV are required.

Remote Interface
-----
A smartphone app that integrates the smartphone memory storage to share messages, and upload them to the event's MessageBooth Local Interface for viewing.

Photo Booth Strip (3 | 4 | 5 sequential pictures)
---
The is a specific presentation of multiple pictures.   However, the sequential timing between photos taken is also important, as it adds to the 'candid' attribute of a traditional photobooth.   

The user can choose the number of pictures (limiting between 3 and 6? inclusive) and the time intervals (likely not to exceed 8 secs or so), the camera takes the photos.   MessageBooth then auto formats them into a strip.   Manual adjustment can cocur on single photos, or the entire strip, sharing preferences are to be chosen, and then the user reviews and submits.

Other
---
Other file types can be shared, and not neccesarily presented on the local display.


Considerations

Sumbission - The capability to accept, review, edit, or reject before [and maybe after] submission
