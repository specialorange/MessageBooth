MessageBooth
=============

A way to communicate with messages for events for remote and attending participants. 

Events are held often.   They often are inbetween celebratory and informative, rarely on either pole, with many smaller events occuring along this linear connection.   MessageBooth tries to address the participatory aspects of large events, by providing a centralized collection of individual and group messages (audio, visual, and electronic) by participants of the event, those in atttendance and remotely.  

Other Potential Names
-
MemoRandom - each message would be a memo , normal spelling is memorandum | memorandom.com is newly registered
BulletinBoard - Each message would be a bullet, the display is the board

Local Interface - Capture
-----
A device to provide locally created messages beyond participants' personal devices will allow for a primary Message creator.   An HD camera, computer (hopefully thin-client or laptop), internet device or connection, and a large screen HDTV are required.

Local Interface - Display
-----
A large screen display to organize and present the messages.  Log In to view private messages. All messages are present to experience.   The admin can de/select types, and review recently posted messages. 

Remote Interface
-----
A smartphone app that integrates the smartphone memory storage to share messages, and upload them to the event's MessageBooth Local Interface for viewing.

Participants
-----
 - Remote
 - Attendees
 - Host / Guests of Honor
 - Sponsor(s)

Communication
-----
Communication of messages can go both ways.    The hosts would initially save asynchronous messages to be viewed by the rest of the participants at the event.   The guessts can then reply to the message to continue the conversation.

Voice / Sound clip
---
Using the microphone from the camera, the attendee(s) can record a sound file for submission.   After recording, the user can opt to keep or delete the sound clip.    Once an acceptable video is acquired, the user can set it's sharing preferences, review the choices, and then submit.

Using the remote interface(either at the even location or remotely), the user can upload (via Twitter, FB, G+, or the phone) to submit an existing sound file for submission.   Once file(s) are selected, the user can set the sharing preferences, review the choices, and submit.

Picture

Using the camera, the attendee(s) can take a picture.   After recording, the user can opt to keep, edit, or delete the picture.  Using other photo editing software, the user can adjust the photo or use presets, review, and then begin to submit.  Once an acceptable picture is acquired, the user can set it's sharing preferences, review the choices, and then submit.

Using the remote interface(either at the even location or remotely), the user can upload (via Twitter, FB, G+, or the phone) to submit an existing photo for submission.   Once file(s) are selected, the user can set the sharing preferences, review the choices, and submit.

Photo Booth Strip (3 | 4 | 5 sequential pictures)
---
The is a specific presentation of multiple pictures.   However, the sequential timing between photos taken is also important, as it adds to the 'candid' attribute of a traditional photobooth.   

The user can choose the number of pictures (limiting between 3 and 6? inclusive) and the time intervals (likely not to exceed 8 secs or so), the camera takes the photos.   MessageBooth then auto formats them into a strip.   Manual adjustment can cocur on single photos, or the entire strip, sharing preferences are to be chosen, and then the user reviews and submits.

Other
---
Other file types can be shared, and not neccesarily presented on the local display.


Considerations

Privacy - A message should have privacy settings of which Participants can view
Sumbission - The capability to accept, review, edit, or reject before [and maybe after] submission
